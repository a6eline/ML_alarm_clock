# Nano ESP32 (Remote) Alarm Clock 
An alarm clock which has to be turned off remotely elsewhere using esp_now one way communication to split system into 2 devices. The purpose of this is to ensure that users get out of bed to turn it off instead of snoozing and going back to bed. 
Implemented using: C/C++, Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Arduino, Librosa, & Audiomentations 
Status: Ongoing
